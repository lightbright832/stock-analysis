# GREEN STOCK ANALYSIS
## Overview of Project
Everyone has heard that stocks are a great way to invest your savings to maximize your earning potential. This project takes a look at the returns offered by the "green stocks" included in the analysis. As an investor the goal is to make a positive return on your investment. Before making future investments it is important to analyze the historical trends of a particular stock before making an initial investment. An analysis may also be performed to see if future contributions will be halted after previous losses. The Green Stock Analysis exposes the growth trends of 12 "green stocks". Initially Steve was only curious about the performance of the "DQ" stock. After running this analysis Steve realized that it is important to look at the performance of all the "green stocks" and not just DQ. Thus the all analysis project was kicked off.

## Years Analyzed
For the all stock analysis Steve wanted to look at the stock returns for the years 2017 and 2018. It is important to look at more than one year of data because any decline in value for one year could be an isolated occurance. To make an informed decision it is best to have as much data as possible. This will enable investors the opportunity to make more reliable investments. A negative return in 2017 and then a positive return in 2018 could mean the stock has rebounded. If there is two years of negative return this may not be the best stock to invest in. Some risk in investing is okay but only the investor can determine his or her risk limit.

## Results
Looking at the results of the analysis it is clear to see that the "green stocks" were doing well in 2017. The only stock that had a negative return for the year was TERP. In this same year DQ experienced a 199.4% return. This offered a lot of promise to investors. We see that things took a turn for the worse in 2018. Majority of the stocks experienced a decline in value in 2018 with almost all showing a negative return. Only ENPH and RUN experienced positive returns for 2018. Based on these results it is great that Steve decided to analyze both years before making any future investments.

## Summary
The stock analysis provided an indepth practical for learning Excel VBA. For anyone who has never worked with this type of coding before it is a great way to get your feet wet. Concepts like for loops and conditionals is a way to make statements or arguments with code. These tools are also another way to automate data analysis without creating pivot tables. While there is nothing wrong with pivot tables VBA is just another way to create and format tables with code using stored data. 
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The most obvious advantage of refactoring code is you change the quality of the code. By refactoring the code you make more precise references. This produces cleaner code which also produces increased white space. This adds to the readability of the code being written. Refactoring is also a great way to cut down on the run time of the code. This was evident in the reduced run time for the refactored code as oppose to the original script. Overall the complexity of the code is reduced with refactoring. Although there are many advantages to refactoring code there are also disadvantages. One of the more cumbersome aspects of refactoring is the time that it takes to refactor the code. With refactoring there is the need to run the functionality of the new code. what may have worked in the original script may have kinks with the refactored code. When a code won't work due to refactoring the entire process almost becomes redundant. So while we appreciate reduced run time the benefits of such time reduction may not outweight the effort put into the refactoring process.
